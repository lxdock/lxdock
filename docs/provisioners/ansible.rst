Ansible
#######

LXDock provides built-in support for `Ansible`_ provisioning.

Requirements
------------

`Ansible`_ v2.0+

Usage
-----

Just append an ``ansible`` provisioning operation to your LXDock file as follows:

.. code-block:: yaml

  name: myproject
  image: ubuntu/bionic

  provisioning:
    - type: ansible
      playbook: deploy/site.yml

Required options
----------------

playbook
========

The ``playbook`` option allows you to define the path to your Ansible playbook you want to run when
your containers are provisioned.

Optional options
----------------

ask_vault_pass
==============

You can use this option to force the use of the ``--ask-vault-pass`` flag when the
``ansible-playbook`` command is executed during the provisioning workflow. Here is an example:

.. code-block:: yaml

  [...]
  provisioning:
    - type: ansible
      playbook: deploy/site.yml
      ask_vault_pass: yes

vault_password_file
===================

You can use this option to specify the path toward the vault password file you want to use when the
``ansible-playbook`` command is executed. Here is an example:

.. code-block:: yaml

  [...]
  provisioning:
    - type: ansible
      playbook: deploy/site.yml
      vault_password_file: secrets/vaultpass

groups
======

Use this option to add groups to the inventory that is dynamically generated by the provisioner.
This option is a hash of lists of container names. Example:

.. code-block:: yaml

  [...]
  provisioning:
    - type: ansible
      playbook: deploy/site.yml
      groups:
        group1:
          - container1
          - container2
        group2:
          - container2

lxd_transport
=============

If this boolean option is set to ``true``, we will use ansible's ``lxd`` transport instead of the
``ssh`` one, thus bypassing ssh entirely and using ``lxc exec`` directly.

It should be noted that while very cool-sounding, this transport method comes with a couple of
drawbacks due to its incomplete support in Ansible. For example, ``synchronize`` actions don't
work.
